### Types of Big Data
1. Structured: Organised data format with a fixed schema. Ex: RDBMS, CSV, XLS
2. Semi-Structured/Multi Structured: Partially organized data which does not have a fixed format. Ex: XML, JSON, DOC
3. Unstructured: Unorganized data with an unknown schema. Ex: Audio, video files, jpg etc.

### Big Data: 3V’s
<strong>Volume</strong>(scale); Ex: CERN’s LHC generates 15 PB a year  
<strong>Velocity</strong>(speed); Ex: Data is generated fast and need to be processed fast. Healthcare Monitoring: Sensors monitoring your activities and body for any abnormal measurements that require immediate action.  
<strong>Variety</strong>(complexity); Ex: A single application can be generating/collecting
many types of data  

### Big Data: 3V’s + 1
Veracity: uncertainty due to data inconsistency and incompleteness  
And more V's
